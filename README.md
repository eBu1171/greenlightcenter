    theme: {
        extend: {
            colors: {
                primary: '#10B981',    // Main brand color
                secondary: '#059669',  // Secondary brand color
                accent: '#34D399',     // Accent color
                dark: '#1F2937',       // Dark text color
                light: '#F9FAFB'       // Light background color
            }
        }
